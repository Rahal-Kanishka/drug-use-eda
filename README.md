The data analysis done on following perspectives

* How participants start using drugs 
* Participant's educations
* Employement
* Social Environment
* Mental Health
* 

## Note
Most records are redundant and the participants has refused to provide any critical information regarding the mental health. Even though the PII(Personally Identifiyable information) has been removed from the records, the information related to geographical information has been changed.

The government authority who did the data collection has used their own grid to mark geography of the participant and I couldn't find any direct link to the zip code or the city of the participants.
